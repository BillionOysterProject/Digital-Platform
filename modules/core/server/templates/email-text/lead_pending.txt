You can explore these features and more with a quick scroll through the BOP Digital Platform Quick Guide: https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=64589a40aed54de69ea6ffab01a0868f   

For extra help, visit our wiki: https://github.com/BillionOysterProject/docs/wiki/Digital-Platform-User-Guide-Table-of-Contents

Currently, your account is pending admin approval.  You'll get full access to the platform once you've attended an Oyster Research Station Basic Training.  (After your training, you'll be able to enter monitoring data, create and share your own lessons, create research posters, and more.)  Learn more here: https://billionoysterproject.org/training/
 
But you don't need to wait for a Basic Training to get involved with BOP!  Come join us at one of our professional developments- most of them are free!  For educators, get started with our curriculum- the Oyster Tank Investigation is a great intro unit you can teach before you get your own Oyster Research Station: https://platform.bop.nyc/units/58a111ed911363392a0a3fc6

And we'd love to help you figure out how to integrate BOP into your classroom or afterschool program- you can reply to this email and someone from our Education team will get back to you soon.

We're glad to have you!
