Hi,

<%= FeedbackName %> from the organization <%= FeedbackOrg %> just reported a status change for the ORS <%= ORSName %>.

New Status: <%= ORSStatus %>
Description: <%= ORSDescription %>
Photo: <%= LinkORSPhoto %>

The status of <%= ORSName %> will not change in the platform until you update it. You can edit the ORS at <%= LinkORSForm %> to reflect any of this new information at any time.

Thanks!
The Billion Oyster Project
