Hi,

<%= TeamLeadName %> just added an unlisted site coordinator for the ORS <%= ORSName %>.

Name: <%= OtherName %>
Email: <%= OtherEmail %>

The site coordinator of <%= ORSName %> will not change in the platform until you update it. You can edit the ORS at <%= LinkORSForm %> to reflect any of this new information at any time.

Thanks!
