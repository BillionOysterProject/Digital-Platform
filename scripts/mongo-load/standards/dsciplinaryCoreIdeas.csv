PS1.A: Structure and Properties of Matter,"Substances are made from different types of atoms, which combine with one another in various ways. Atoms form molecules that range in size from two to thousands of atoms."
PS1.A: Structure and Properties of Matter,"Solids may be formed from molecules, or they may be extended structures with repeating subunits (e.g., crystals)."
PS1.A: Structure and Properties of Matter,Each pure substance has characteristic physical and chemical properties (for any bulk quantity under given conditions) that can be used to identify it.
PS1.A: Structure and Properties of Matter,Gases and liquids are made of molecules or inert atoms that are moving about relative to each other.
PS1.A: Structure and Properties of Matter,"In a liquid, the molecules are constantly in contact with others; in a gas, they are widely spaced except when they happen to collide. In a solid, atoms are closely spaced and may vibrate in position but do not change relative locations."
PS1.A: Structure and Properties of Matter,The changes of state that occur with variations in temperature or pressure can be described and predicted using these models of matter.
PS1.B: Chemical Reactions,"Substances react chemically in characteristic ways. In a chemical process, the atoms that make up the original substances are regrouped into different molecules, and these new substances have different properties from those of the reactants."
PS1.B: Chemical Reactions,"The total number of each type of atom is conserved, and thus the mass does not change."
PS1.B: Chemical Reactions,"Some chemical reactions release energy, others store energy."
PS2.A: Forces and Motion,"For any pair of interacting objects, the force exerted by the first object on the second object is equal in strength to the force that the second object exerts on the first, but in the opposite direction (Newton’s third law)."
PS2.A: Forces and Motion,"The motion of an object is determined by the sum of the forces acting on it; if the total force on the object is not zero, its motion will change. The greater the mass of the object, the greater the force needed to achieve the same change in motion. For any given object, a larger force causes a larger change in motion."
PS2.A: Forces and Motion,"All positions of objects and the directions of forces and motions must be described in an arbitrarily chosen reference frame and arbitrarily chosen units of size. In order to share information with other people, these choices must also be shared."
PS2.B: Types of Interactions,"Electric and magnetic (electromagnetic) forces can be attractive or repulsive, and their sizes depend on the magnitudes of the charges, currents, or magnetic strengths involved and on the distances between the interacting objects."
PS2.B: Types of Interactions,"Gravitational forces are always attractive. There is a gravitational force between any two masses, but it is very small except when one or both of the objects have large mass—e.g., Earth and the sun."
PS2.B: Types of Interactions,"Forces that act at a distance (electric, magnetic, and gravitational) can be explained by fields that extend through space and can be mapped by their effect on a test object (a charged object, or a ball, respectively)."
PS3.A: Definitions of Energy,"The term “heat” as used in everyday language refers both to thermal energy (the motion of atoms or molecules within a substance) and the transfer of that thermal energy from one object to another. In science, heat is used only for this second meaning; it refers to the energy transferred due to the temperature difference between two objects. (secondary)"
PS3.A: Definitions of Energy,"The temperature of a system is proportional to the average internal kinetic energy and potential energy per atom or molecule (whichever is the appropriate building block for the system’s material). The details of that relationship depend on the type of atom or molecule and the interactions among the atoms in the material. Temperature is not a direct measure of a system's total thermal energy. The total thermal energy (sometimes called the total internal energy) of a system depends jointly on the temperature, the total number of atoms in the system, and the state of the material. (secondary)"
PS3.A: Definitions of Energy,Motion energy is properly called kinetic energy; it is proportional to the mass of the moving object and grows with the square of its speed.
PS3.A: Definitions of Energy,"A system of objects may also contain stored (potential) energy, depending on their relative positions."
PS3.A: Definitions of Energy,"Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles of matter. The relationship between the temperature and the total energy of a system depends on the types, states, and amounts of matter present. ETS1.B: Developing Possible Solutions"
PS3.A: Definitions of Energy,"A solution needs to be tested, and then modified on the basis of the test results, in order to improve it. (secondary)"
PS3.B: Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer,Energy is spontaneously transferred out of hotter regions or objects and into colder ones.
PS3.B: Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer,"The amount of energy transfer needed to change the temperature of a matter sample by a given amount depends on the nature of the matter, the size of the sample, and the environment."
PS3.B: Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer,"When the motion energy of an object changes, there is inevitably some other change in energy at the same time."
PS3.C: Relationship Between Energy and Forces,"When two objects interact, each one exerts a force on the other that can cause energy to be transferred to or from the object."
PS3.D: Energy in Chemical Processes and Everyday Life,"The chemical reaction by which plants produce complex food molecules (sugars) requires an energy input (i.e., from sunlight) to occur. In this reaction, carbon dioxide and water combine to form carbon-based organic molecules and release oxygen. (secondary)"
PS3.D: Energy in Chemical Processes and Everyday Life,"Cellular respiration in plants and animals involve chemical reactions with oxygen that release stored energy. In these processes, complex molecules containing carbon react with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and other materials. (secondary)"
PS4.A: Wave Properties,"A simple wave has a repeating pattern with a specific wavelength, frequency, and amplitude."
PS4.A: Wave Properties,A sound wave needs a medium through which it is transmitted.
PS4.B: Electromagnetic Radiation,"When light shines on an object, it is reflected, absorbed, or transmitted through the object, depending on the object’s material and the frequency (color) of the light."
PS4.B: Electromagnetic Radiation,"The path that light travels can be traced as straight lines, except at surfaces between different transparent materials (e.g., air and water, air and glass) where the light path bends."
PS4.B: Electromagnetic Radiation,"A wave model of light is useful for explaining brightness, color, and the frequency-dependent bending of light at a surface between media."
PS4.B: Electromagnetic Radiation,"However, because light can travel through space, it cannot be a matter wave, like sound or water waves."
PS4.C: Information Technologies and Instrumentation,Digitized signals (sent as wave pulses) are a more reliable way to encode and transmit information.
LS1.A: Structure and Function,"All living things are made up of cells, which is the smallest unit that can be said to be alive. An organism may consist of one single cell (unicellular) or many different numbers and types of cells (multicellular)."
LS1.A: Structure and Function,"Within cells, special structures are responsible for particular functions, and the cell membrane forms the boundary that controls what enters and leaves the cell."
LS1.A: Structure and Function,"In multicellular organisms, the body is a system of multiple interacting subsystems. These subsystems are groups of cells that work together to form tissues and organs that are specialized for particular body functions."
LS1.B: Growth and Development of Organisms,Animals engage in characteristic behaviors that increase the odds of reproduction.
LS1.B: Growth and Development of Organisms,"Plants reproduce in a variety of ways, sometimes depending on animal behavior and specialized features for reproduction."
LS1.B: Growth and Development of Organisms,Genetic factors as well as local conditions affect the growth of the adult plant.
LS1.B: Growth and Development of Organisms,"Organisms reproduce, either sexually or asexually, and transfer their genetic information to their offspring. (secondary)"
LS1.C: Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms,"Plants, algae (including phytoplankton), and many microorganisms use the energy from light to make sugars (food) from carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water through the process of photosynthesis, which also releases oxygen. These sugars can be used immediately or stored for growth or later use."
LS1.C: Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms,"Within individual organisms, food moves through a series of chemical reactions in which it is broken down and rearranged to form new molecules, to support growth, or to release energy."
LS1.D: Information Processing,"Each sense receptor responds to different inputs (electromagnetic, mechanical, chemical), transmitting them as signals that travel along nerve cells to the brain. The signals are then processed in the brain, resulting in immediate behaviors or memories."
LS2.A: Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems,"Organisms, and populations of organisms, are dependent on their environmental interactions both with other living things and with nonliving factors. "
LS2.A: Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems,"In any ecosystem, organisms and populations with similar requirements for food, water, oxygen, or other resources may compete with each other for limited resources, access to which consequently constrains their growth and reproduction. "
LS2.A: Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems,Growth of organisms and population increases are limited by access to resources.
LS2.A: Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems,"Similarly, predatory interactions may reduce the number of organisms or eliminate whole populations of organisms. Mutually beneficial interactions, in contrast, may become so interdependent that each organism requires the other for survival. Although the species involved in these competitive, predatory, and mutually beneficial interactions vary across ecosystems, the patterns of interactions of organisms with their environments, both living and nonliving, are shared."
LS2.B: Cycle of Matter and Energy Transfer in Ecosystems,"Food webs are models that demonstrate how matter and energy is transferred between producers, consumers, and decomposers as the three groups interact within an ecosystem. Transfers of matter into and out of the physical environment occur at every level. Decomposers recycle nutrients from dead plant or animal matter back to the soil in terrestrial environments or to the water in aquatic environments. The atoms that make up the organisms in an ecosystem are cycled repeatedly between the living and nonliving parts of the ecosystem."
"LS2.C: Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience",Ecosystems are dynamic in nature; their characteristics can vary over time. Disruptions to any physical or biological component of an ecosystem can lead to shifts in all its populations.
"LS2.C: Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience",Biodiversity describes the variety of species found in Earth’s terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems. The completeness or integrity of an ecosystem’s biodiversity is often used as a measure of its health.
LS4.D: Biodiversity and Humans,"Changes in biodiversity can influence humans’ resources, such as food, energy, and medicines, as well as ecosystem services that humans rely on—for example, water purification and recycling. (secondary)"
LS3.A: Inheritance of Traits,"Genes are located in the chromosomes of cells, with each chromosome pair containing two variants of each of many distinct genes. Each distinct gene chiefly controls the production of specific proteins, which in turn affects the traits of the individual. Changes (mutations) to genes can result in changes to proteins, which can affect the structures and functions of the organism and thereby change traits."
LS3.A: Inheritance of Traits,Variations of inherited traits between parent and offspring arise from genetic differences that result from the subset of chromosomes (and therefore genes) inherited.
LS3.B: Variation of Traits,"In addition to variations that arise from sexual reproduction, genetic information can be altered because of mutations. Though rare, mutations may result in changes to the structure and function of proteins. Some changes are beneficial, others harmful, and some neutral to the organism."
LS3.B: Variation of Traits,"In sexually reproducing organisms, each parent contributes half of the genes acquired (at random) by the offspring. Individuals have two of each chromosome and hence two alleles of each gene, one acquired from each parent. These versions may be identical or may differ from each other."
S4.A: Evidence of Common Ancestry and Diversity,"The collection of fossils and their placement in chronological order (e.g., through the location of the sedimentary layers in which they are found or through radioactive dating) is known as the fossil record. It documents the existence, diversity, extinction, and change of many life forms throughout the history of life on Earth."
S4.A: Evidence of Common Ancestry and Diversity,"Anatomical similarities and differences between various organisms living today and between them and organisms in the fossil record, enable the reconstruction of evolutionary history and the inference of lines of evolutionary descent."
S4.A: Evidence of Common Ancestry and Diversity,Comparison of the embryological development of different species also reveals similarities that show relationships not evident in the fully-formed anatomy.
LS4.B: Natural Selection,"Natural selection leads to the predominance of certain traits in a population, and the suppression of others."
LS4.B: Natural Selection,"In artificial selection, humans have the capacity to influence certain characteristics of organisms by selective breeding. One can choose desired parental traits determined by genes, which are then passed on to offspring."
LS4.C: Adaptation,"Adaptation by natural selection acting over generations is one important process by which species change over time in response to changes in environmental conditions. Traits that support successful survival and reproduction in the new environment become more common; those that do not become less common. Thus, the distribution of traits in a population changes."
ESS1.A: The Universe and Its Stars,"Patterns of the apparent motion of the sun, the moon, and stars in the sky can be observed, described, predicted, and explained with models. "
ESS1.A: The Universe and Its Stars,"Earth and its solar system are part of the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies in the universe. "
ESS1.B: Earth and the Solar System,This model of the solar system can explain eclipses of the sun and the moon. Earth’s spin axis is fixed in direction over the short-term but tilted relative to its orbit around the sun. The seasons are a result of that tilt and are caused by the differential intensity of sunlight on different areas of Earth across the year.
ESS1.B: Earth and the Solar System,"The solar system consists of the sun and a collection of objects, including planets, their moons, and asteroids that are held in orbit around the sun by its gravitational pull on them. "
ESS1.B: Earth and the Solar System,"The solar system appears to have formed from a disk of dust and gas, drawn together by gravity."
ESS1.C: The History of Planet Earth,"The geologic time scale interpreted from rock strata provides a way to organize Earth’s history. Analyses of rock strata and the fossil record provide only relative dates, not an absolute scale."
ESS1.C: The History of Planet Earth,"Tectonic processes continually generate new ocean sea floor at ridges and destroy old sea floor at trenches. (HS.ESS1.C GBE),(secondary)"
ESS2.A: Earth’s Materials and Systems,All Earth processes are the result of energy flowing and matter cycling within and among the planet’s systems. This energy is derived from the sun and Earth’s hot interior. The energy that flows and matter that cycles produce chemical and physical changes in Earth’s materials and living organisms.
ESS2.A: Earth’s Materials and Systems,"The planet’s systems interact over scales that range from microscopic to global in size, and they operate over fractions of a second to billions of years. These interactions have shaped Earth’s history and will determine its future. "
ESS2.C: The Roles of Water in Earth's Surface Processes,"Water’s movements—both on the land and underground—cause weathering and erosion, which change the land’s surface features and create underground formations."
ESS2.C: The Roles of Water in Earth's Surface Processes,"Water continually cycles among land, ocean, and atmosphere via transpiration, evaporation, condensation and crystallization, and precipitation, as well as downhill flows on land."
ESS2.C: The Roles of Water in Earth's Surface Processes,Global movements of water and its changes in form are propelled by sunlight and gravity.
ESS2.C: The Roles of Water in Earth's Surface Processes,"The complex patterns of the changes and the movement of water in the atmosphere, determined by winds, landforms, and ocean temperatures and currents, are major determinants of local weather patterns."
ESS2.C: The Roles of Water in Earth's Surface Processes,Variations in density due to variations in temperature and salinity drive a global pattern of interconnected ocean
ESS2.B: Plate Tectonics and Large-Scale System Interactions,"Maps of ancient land and water patterns, based on investigations of rocks and fossils, make clear how Earth’s plates have moved great distances, collided, and spread apart."
ESS2.D: Weather and Climate,"Because these patterns are so complex, weather can only be predicted probabilistically."
ESS2.D: Weather and Climate,"Weather and climate are influenced by interactions involving sunlight, the ocean, the atmosphere, ice, landforms, and living things. These interactions vary with latitude, altitude, and local and regional geography, all of which can affect oceanic and atmospheric flow patterns."
ESS2.D: Weather and Climate,"The ocean exerts a major influence on weather and climate by absorbing energy from the sun, releasing it over time, and globally redistributing it through ocean currents."
ESS3.A: Natural Resources ,"Humans depend on Earth’s land, ocean, atmosphere, and biosphere for many different resources. Minerals, fresh water, and biosphere resources are limited, and many are not renewable or replaceable over human lifetimes. These resources are distributed unevenly around the planet as a result of past geologic processes."
ESS3.B: Natural Hazards,"Mapping the history of natural hazards in a region, combined with an understanding of related geologic forces can help forecast the locations and likelihoods of future events."
ESS3.C: Human Impacts on Earth Systems,"Human activities have significantly altered the biosphere, sometimes damaging or destroying natural habitats and causing the extinction of other species. But changes to Earth’s environments can have different impacts (negative and positive) for different living things. "
ESS3.C: Human Impacts on Earth Systems,"Typically as human populations and per-capita consumption of natural resources increase, so do the negative impacts on Earth unless the activities and technologies involved are engineered otherwise."
ESS3.D: Global Climate Change,"Human activities, such as the release of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, are major factors in the current rise in Earth’s mean surface temperature (global warming). Reducing the level of climate change and reducing human vulnerability to whatever climate changes do occur depend on the understanding of climate science, engineering capabilities, and other kinds of knowledge, such as understanding of human behavior and on applying that knowledge wisely in decisions and activities."
