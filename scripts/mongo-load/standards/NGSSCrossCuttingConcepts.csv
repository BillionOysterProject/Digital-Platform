Patterns,Macroscopic patterns are related to the nature of microscopic and atomic-level structure.
Patterns,Graphs and charts can be used to identify patterns in data.
Patterns,"Graphs, charts, and images can be used to identify patterns in data."
Patterns,Patterns can be used to identify cause and effect relationships.
Patterns,Patterns in rates of change and other numerical relationships can provide information about natural systems.
Cause and Effect,Cause and effect relationships may be used to predict phenomena in natural systems.
Cause and Effect,Cause and effect relationships may be used to predict phenomena in natural or designed systems.
Cause and Effect,"Phenomena may have more than one cause, and some cause and effect relationships in systems can only be described using probability."
Cause and Effect,"Relationships can be classified as causal or correlational, and correlation does not necessarily imply causation."
"Scale, Proportion, and Quantity",Proportional relationships (e.g. speed as the ratio of distance traveled to time taken) among different types of quantities provide information about the magnitude of properties and processes.
"Scale, Proportion, and Quantity",Phenomena that can be observed at one scale may not be observable at another scale.
"Scale, Proportion, and Quantity","Time, space, and energy phenomena can be observed at various scales using models to study systems that are too large or too small."
Systems and System Models,"Models can be used to represent systems and their interactions—such as inputs, processes and outputs—and energy and matter flows within systems."
Systems and System Models,Models can be used to represent systems and their interactions.
Systems and System Models,"Models can be used to represent systems and their interactions—such as inputs, processes and outputs—and energy, matter, and information flows within systems."
Systems and System Models,Systems may interact with other systems; they may have sub-systems and be a part of larger complex systems.
Energy and Matter,The transfer of energy can be tracked as energy flows through a designed or natural system
Energy and Matter," Energy may take different forms (e.g. energy in fields, thermal energy, energy of motion)."
Energy and Matter,"Within a natural system, the transfer of energy drives the motion and/or cycling of matter."
Energy and Matter,"Within a natural or designed system, the transfer of energy drives the motion and/or cycling of matter."
Energy and Matter,Matter is conserved because atoms are conserved in physical and chemical processes.
Energy and Matter,The transfer of energy can be tracked as energy flows through a natural system.
Structure and Function,Structures can be designed to serve particular functions.
Structure and Function,"Structures can be designed to serve particular functions by taking into account properties of different materials, and how materials can be shaped and used."
Structure and Function,"Complex and microscopic structures and systems can be visualized, modeled, and used to describe how their function depends on the relationships among its parts, therefore complex natural structures/systems can be analyzed to determine how they function."
Stability and Change,Explanations of stability and change in natural or designed systems can be constructed by examining the changes over time and forces at different scales.
Stability and Change,"Explanations of stability and change in natural or designed systems can be constructed by examining the changes over time and processes at different scales, including the atomic scale."
Stability and Change,Small changes in one part of a system might cause large changes in another part.
Stability and Change,Stability might be disturbed either by sudden events or gradual changes that accumulate over time.
"Interdependence of Science, Engineering, and Technology","Engineering advances have led to important discoveries in virtually every field of science, and scientific discoveries have led to the development of entire industries and engineered systems."
"Influence of Engineering, Technology, and Science on Society and the Natural World","The uses of technologies and any limitation on their use are driven by individual or societal needs, desires, and values; by the findings of scientific research; and by differences in such factors as climate, natural resources, and economic conditions. Thus technology use varies from region to region and over time."
"Influence of Engineering, Technology, and Science on Society and the Natural World","Technologies extend the measurement, exploration, modeling, and computational capacity of scientific investigations"
"Influence of Engineering, Technology, and Science on Society and the Natural World","All human activity draws on natural resources and has both short and long-term consequences, positive as well as negative, for the health of people and the natural environment."
Science as a Human Endeavor,Advances in technology influence the progress of science and science has influenced advances in technology
Science as a Human Endeavor,"Scientists and engineers are guided by habits of mind such as intellectual honesty, tolerance of ambiguity, skepticism, and openness to new ideas."
Science Addresses Questions About the Natural and Material World,Scientific knowledge can describe the consequences of actions but does not necessarily prescribe the decisions that society takes
Scientific Knowledge Assumes an Order and Consistency in Natural Systems,Science assumes that objects and events in natural systems occur in consistent patterns that are understandable through measurement and observation.
