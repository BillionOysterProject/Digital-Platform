In order to eat, oysters open their shells slightly, exposing the little hairlike structures on their gills, called cilia. &nbsp;The oyster moves these cilia in a wavelike motion creating a localized water current, thereby drawing the water inward and over the gills. &nbsp;This process both ventilates the oysters gills for respiration and captures particles that the oyster will eat. The exact mechanism of particle capture is a complex one, and is accomplished in two different ways: the hydrodynamic mechanism draws in particles through the movement of water; and the mucociliary mechanism uses cilia structures and mucous to capture particles. Particles removed from suspension by these two mechanisms are transported along the gills to the labial palps. </span></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><b><span style=\"color: rgb(230, 0, 0);\">&lt;INSERT PIC&gt; </span></b></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\">see - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QUGOqmb2wlQ9AWb05xI4LuyisyQa7bUsYyhEYTZj9tI/edit</div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.6667px; background-color: transparent;\">The mechanism by which oysters and other bivalves differentiate between different types of particles is not well understood.

Water that doesn’t evaporate or infiltrate becomes surface water runoff. Surface water may flow over the ground surface or enter storm drains. &nbsp;Water captured by storm drains flows downhill through sewer pipes (downhill direction determined by the pipe orientation) into a wastewater treatment plant. Stormwater shares these pipes with raw sewage (also called the sanitary sewer). The stormwater is treated and then discharged into the nearest body of water. However, when the sewer system becomes overwhelmed with storm water, both the raw sewage and storm water flow directly into the nearest body of water through combined sewer overflow (CSO) outfalls. &nbsp;This means that almost every time it rains we have raw sewage flowing into our harbor.</span></div>","explore":"<ol><li>Students will go outdoors and become water cycle sleuths.
